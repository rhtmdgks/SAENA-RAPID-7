"""Publisher port + adapters — topic dispatch for validated envelopes (W2C).

Spec basis: `docs/architecture/implementation-waves.md` W2C exit ("outbox
drain→토픽 발행(3-context envelope 검증), consumer idempotency"), ADR-0013
(`event_type` == AsyncAPI topic name, 1:1 mapping — no double management),
ADR-0004 (Redpanda = data pool component), ADR-0015 (DLQ naming
`<topic>.dlq`, wiring deferred to W2C — this module is that wiring).

`Publisher` is a `typing.Protocol`: one async method, `publish(topic,
envelope)`. Two concrete adapters:

- `InMemoryPublisher` — pure in-process reference implementation. Records
  every published `(topic, envelope)` pair in call order; used by unit tests
  and any pre-Redpanda caller. Never raises for a well-formed call (a test
  that needs to exercise `OutboxDrainer`'s publish-failure retry path injects
  a small wrapper/subclass that raises on demand — see
  `tests/unit/domain_bus/bus_factories.py`).
- `RedpandaPublisher` — thin `aiokafka.AIOKafkaProducer` wrapper. Configured
  via an injected `RedpandaConfig` dataclass (bootstrap servers + optional
  SASL/TLS material passed through as opaque strings the caller already
  resolved from a secret store) — this module NEVER reads environment
  variables or embeds credentials itself (CLAUDE.md Constraints: "Secrets
  never in prompts... audit payloads"; the same discipline applies to source
  code — no hardcoded broker addresses or credentials here).

Topic selection (ADR-0013 1:1 rule): `topic == envelope["event_type"]` for a
publish to a MAIN topic. Publishing to a DLQ uses `<topic>.dlq` (ADR-0015) —
callers (here, `OutboxDrainer`) compute that name via `dlq_topic_for`, this
module does not special-case DLQ topic strings itself; a `Publisher` treats
every `topic` argument identically (just a destination string), keeping the
DLQ-naming policy entirely in the drainer/caller layer where ADR-0015 places
it.

Partition-key choice (documented per task spec instruction): `key =
envelope["idempotency_key"]` when present (every ADR-0013 v1 envelope
carries a non-empty `idempotency_key` — the 8th common field, frozen), else
falling back to `tenant_id` for `context_type: tenant` envelopes. This
maximizes redelivery/ordering affinity for the SAME logical event (the
idempotency key is unique per logical event, which is a stronger, more
evenly-distributed partitioning key than `tenant_id` alone would be for a
tenant with many concurrent events) while still keeping same-tenant events on
a stable, ordered subset of partitions as a secondary benefit.
`context_type: system`/`aggregate` envelopes have no `tenant_id` at all, so
`idempotency_key` is their only available key — using it is not a fallback
for those two branches, it is the ONLY structurally available choice.
