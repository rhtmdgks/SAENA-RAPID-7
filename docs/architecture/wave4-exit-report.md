# Wave 4 (Intelligence) — exit report

Branch: `wave4-intelligence` (from `main` = `a1f1b08`, merged Wave 3 PR #4).
Authority + DAG: `docs/architecture/wave4-plan.md`. This is a Wave-4 WORK
document, not `docs/specs/**`.

## Status

Stage 0–3 COMPLETE. **PR #5 (Wave 4 → main) was MERGED — main = `a8de390`.**
A follow-on remediation (`wave4-remediation`, branched from `a8de390`) then
closed four concurrency/integrity/privacy defects the original W4 CI did not
catch — see `docs/architecture/wave4-remediation-report.md` and the
"Post-merge remediation" section below.

## Verification evidence

- Blocking unit lane (`just test` = `-m "not integration"`): **4113 passed**, 38
  skipped, 0 failed.
- `just verify` green at every integration commit: 11 import-linter contracts
  KEPT (incl. `services-are-independent` covering all 4 intelligence services +
  observer; `*-below-services` for clickhouse/vector), coverage ratchet held at
  the 99% baseline, ruff + mypy + JSON-Schema + AsyncAPI + OpenAPI validation
  clean.
- 22 commits `a1f1b08..HEAD`.

## Wave-4 scope adherence (forbidden-scope NOT touched)

- Engine = **chatgpt-search ONLY**. Google AIO/AI-Mode/Gemini rejected at the
  shared `guard_engine_id` / `EngineFactory` boundary and per-service; pinned by
  `tests/security/test_intel_engine_scope.py` (mutation-verified).
- Experiment feature is **registration ONLY** — NO outcome/DiD/causal/lift/
  KPI-weight. The open-class event payloads (ADR-0012) cannot schema-reject a
  stray `lift`/`outcome` field, so that boundary is documented as the
  `outcome-field-gap` **policy-gate obligation** (contract gap fixture +
  `failure_mode_matrix.json` `missing_owner_note`), not silently treated as
  enforced. NOT implemented: absorption-analysis (P1), digital-twin,
  portfolio-optimizer, strategy-skill-bank, strategy-card, outcome analysis.
- No production observation / deploy / release / tag. Helm is chart definition
  only.

## Data-isolation & security invariants (tested)

- `tenant_id` discriminator on every tenant-scoped record/event; cross-tenant
  access fail-closed and **non-leaking** (tenant-B-vs-real and
  tenant-B-vs-nonexistent raise structurally identical errors) — entity/demand/
  claim-evidence stores + artifact gateway + QEEG projection.
- Raw customer content never inlined: observations carry only `raw_object_ref` +
  `artifact_hash`; a planted raw-content marker is proven absent from record,
  event payload, audit trail, and a simulated log line.
- No PII/secret in event payloads or observability labels.
- ClickHouse tenant-level partition FORBIDDEN (time-partition + ORDER BY tenant
  prefix); vector per-product namespace.

## OPEN decisions (isolated, not invented — per wave4-plan §"OPEN decisions")

Vector product (Qdrant vs pgvector) → port + pgvector CI backend. Embedding
model/version → deterministic TestEmbedder, provider production-only. ClickHouse
TTL/retention → unset, production-only (values comment). PII-vs-audit legal →
gates Wave 5; W4 ledger carries no PII. Graph store (Neo4j vs Postgres) → out of
W4 (QEEG is read-only projection). Managed vs in-cluster data services → external
SecretRef, production-only. None blocked a W4 unit.

## Stage 3 (integration/E2E depth + CI wiring) — COMPLETE

- w4-13 observation→artifact→ClickHouse→citation pipeline: 15 tests, verified
  LIVE against a real ClickHouse container (`tests/integration/intelligence_pipeline/**`).
- w4-17 composite synthetic E2E: 31 tests (26 synthetic + 5 real-ClickHouse),
  whole-chain determinism + tenant isolation + registration-only experiment leg
  (`tests/e2e/intelligence/**`, `tests/integration/intelligence_e2e/**`).
- w4-18 failure/rollback/rebuild/idempotency: 35 tests (incl. real-Postgres) —
  idempotent replay, QEEG rebuild, fail-closed rollback (no partial state),
  tenant isolation under failure, ledger tamper detection
  (`tests/integration/intelligence_failure/**`).
- w4-19 named CI checks (justfile SSOT + `.github/workflows/ci.yml` jobs):
  `browser-observer`, `storage-integration`, `qeeg-replay`,
  `experiment-integrity`, `intelligence-e2e` — all pass locally.

## w4-20 final verification

Two independent critics (Security/Data-Isolation, Architecture/Evidence-
Integrity) were dispatched. Per the honest-critic convention established in
Wave 3, they idle-signalled without delivering a bus verdict, so the Lead
performed the adversarial verification directly (documented, not claimed as a
critic PASS):

**Security / Data-Isolation → PASS.** Engine scope is a closed enum
(`ALLOWED_ENGINE_IDS = {"chatgpt-search"}`) + the central
`saena_domain.execution.guard_engine_id`; no bypass/override/default engine path
exists (the only "default" references are comments asserting none is hardcoded).
Tenant isolation: 96 tenant guards, every store getter takes `tenant_id` as its
first parameter, cross-tenant access fail-closes and does not leak existence
(13 mutation-verified tests in `test_intel_tenant_isolation.py`). Raw-content
discipline is defended in depth: observation payloads carry only
`raw_object_ref`+`artifact_hash`; `saena_analytics_clickhouse.guard.guard_row_fields`
is invoked at all three ClickHouse insert sites (`rows.py`) and fail-closed
rejects any raw_content/raw_html/screenshot/response_body/secret column;
observability redaction denylists claim_text/excerpt/source_uri/query_text. No
live-observation path — fixture browser only, real Playwright driver guarded +
coverage-omitted.

**Architecture / Evidence-Integrity → PASS.** No outcome/DiD/causal/lift logic
exists in the intelligence stack — every such token in `src/**` is a negative
assertion of the boundary, not a computation; `FORBIDDEN_OUTCOME_TOKENS` is a
real structural guard. Both the experiment ledger and the claim-evidence ledger
import `saena_domain.audit.canonical.canonical_json`/`sha256_hex` verbatim (no
new hashing rule); tamper (content/forged-hash/forged-previous-hash) is detected
at genesis/middle/prior entries (w4-18). QEEG projection is read-only
(write-method-monkeypatch test) and deterministically rebuildable by replay;
publishability is copied verbatim from the fail-closed write-model. Determinism
(identical graph_version/content_hash across runs) is proven by w4-13/w4-17. All
11 import-linter boundary contracts KEPT; registry 26→38 with codegen↔schema
parity.

## Post-merge remediation (wave4-remediation)

PR #5 merged to main at `a8de390`. A post-merge audit found four defects the
original CI missed; `wave4-remediation` (from `a8de390`) closes them, each
reproducer-first + real-container verified (full detail:
`wave4-remediation-report.md`):

- **r4-01** pgvector concurrent upsert — advisory lock + partial unique index
  (the original `FOR UPDATE` locked nothing on a first-empty-key race).
- **r4-02** ClickHouse idempotency — server-side dedup token replaces a
  check-then-insert race. Guarantee is **window-bounded physical + logical**
  (disclosed), not unconditional physical exactly-once.
- **r4-03** experiment ledger — chain-entry hash now commits `previous_hash`
  (reorder+relink previously passed verify); content-fingerprint vs chain-hash
  split.
- **r4-04** query privacy — raw `query_text` removed from ClickHouse; replaced
  by a **keyed, tenant-scoped, fail-closed** `query_ref` (the earlier
  exit-report "no raw content/PII" claim was stronger than the code enforced —
  now it holds).

Verdicts recorded as **Lead verification** (no separate critic delivered a bus
verdict; the Lead ran the adversarial checks directly against real containers,
and acted as the independent critic that found + returned r4-04's two MUST-FIX
defects). Remediation gates: `vector-concurrency`, `analytics-idempotency`,
`experiment-chain-adversarial`, `intelligence-privacy` (justfile SSOT + ci.yml).

## Remaining

- Wave-4-remediation → main PR (CI green). **Merge is a human decision — no
  auto-merge.**
